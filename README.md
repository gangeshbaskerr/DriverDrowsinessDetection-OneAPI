Accidents caused due to driver drowsiness are a major public health and safety issue, affecting millions of people every year. According to the National Safety Council, driving while drowsy is similar to driving while intoxicated, as it impairs drivers attention, reaction time, and decision making, leading to fatal or serious crashes. Several factors can increase the risk of drowsy driving, such as lack of sleep, sleep disorders, shift work, medications, and alcohol.

Research shows that driver fatigue may be a contributory factor in up to 20% of road accidents, and up to one quarter of fatal and serious accidents. An estimated 1,550 deaths, 71,000 injuries, and $12.5 billion in monetary losses are due to drowsy drivers in a year.

# Introduction <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/152814876-73362bcc-bde6-411f-ba80-235e911f276f.gif" width="90" height="90">

The drowsiness detection system monitors the driver's condition and issues an alert if it detects signs of drowsiness using CNN - Python, OpenCV.

This system aims to reduce the number of accidents on the road by detecting the driver's drowsiness and warning them using an alarm‚è∞.

# Approach <img src="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/data-science-2-1/66/119-512.png" width="90" height="80"> 
Here, we used Python, OpenCV, and Keras(Tensorflow) to build a system that can detect features from the face of the drivers and alert them if they ever fall asleep while driving. The system detects the eyes and prompts if it is closed or open. If the eyes are closed for 10 seconds, it will play the alarm to get the driver's attention to stop because the system has detected drowsiness. We have built a model of CNN network trained on a dataset using OneAPI that can detect closed and open eyes. Then OpenCV is used to get the live feed from the camera and run every frame through the CNN model to process it and classify whether it is opened or closed eyes.

**How does OneApi provide better performance :**
    
Today‚Äôs compute systems are heterogeneous and include CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators. The different architectures exhibit varied                   characteristics that can be matched to specific workloads for the best performance.

Having multiple types of compute architectures leads to different programming and optimization needs. oneAPI and SYCL provide a programming model, whether through direct programming or libraries, that can be utilized to develop software tailored to each of the architectures.
    
**Advantages of using OneAPi :**

1) We can use Single code for both cpu and GPU (heterogeneous¬†computing)
2) To implement machine learning based IoT projects easily with less hardwares as the machine learning part happens in cloud
3) To process files faster ie. it takes less time to run the epochs
4) OneAPI allows users to transcend Hardware restrictions and provide better performance for low powered¬†computers

    oneAPI is an open-source software toolkit developed by Intel that simplifies the development of high-performance, heterogeneous applications. It allows       developers to write code that can run efficiently on a variety of architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. oneDNN (Deep Neural Network) is a part     of oneAPI and is an optimized library for deep learning. It provides highly optimized building blocks for neural network models that run efficiently on a     variety of hardware platforms.

# Project Deployment <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130077430/230725195-2f024fca-9cae-4e91-85dc-4c12e0e1fcb0.png" width="90" height="80">

We have built an app using Flutter. Flutter helps Build, test, and deploy beautiful mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase. It is a cross-platform app development framework by Google which goes hand in hand with the model to help ensure the safety of the user and other commuters. 

As soon as the model detects drowsiness, the model will send an API request call to the client app, which notifies the user to take some rest and shows the navigation option to the nearest resting places. If the user isn't drowsy, the app will give 10 seconds buffer time within which the user can confirm that he isn't sleepy by pressing the prompt on the screen. If the user is drowsy he will get a option for getting driving assistance from the nearby driving service providers. If the user has been detected drowsy more than three times within 10 minutes, a notification is sent to the highway patrol and the nearby drivers as a concern for the safety of other drivers and the drowsy driver.

1) **Distraction detection :**
    When no eyes is detected while face is detected, It can be called distraction and that can also be added to this model. 

2) **Alcohol gas detection :**
    The MQ3 alcohol gas sensor is a module used for detecting alcohol, CH4, benzene, gasoline, hexane, CO, and LPG. It has a sensitive material namedSnO2 for     alcohol¬†gas¬†detection, This code can be easily pared with MQ3 sensor to extend its detection in¬†drunken¬†driving.

3) This module can be integrated with the driving system in cars to slow them down and bring¬†them¬†to¬†stop when drowsiness is detected, its even better with      autonomous cars as they can take over the driver and park the car in a safe place and prompt the driver to rest for few hours and then continue¬†their        journey.
