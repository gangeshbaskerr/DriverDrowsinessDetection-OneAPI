Phishing attacks have emerged as a significant and persistent threat in the digital landscape, targeting individuals, organizations, and even governments. These deceptive techniques employed by cybercriminals aim to trick unsuspecting users into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data.

Research shows that Over 48% of emails sent in 2022 were spam, and up to an estimated 3.4 billion spam emails sent every day. Globally, 323,972 internet users fell victim to phishing attacks in 2021 and With an average of $136 lost per phishing attack, this amounts to $44.2 million stolen by cyber criminals through phishing attacks in 2021.

# Problem Statement <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130077430/230730194-a7389fed-f5fd-48d3-856a-0212057f2500.png" width="90" height="80">

Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to online users, compromising their privacy, financial security, and trust in online interactions. Detecting and mitigating phishing sites remains challenging, requiring effective techniques to identify and differentiate between legitimate and malicious websites accurately.

Existing phishing detection methods often struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals, necessitating the development of an enhanced approach for phishing site detection. 

Therefore, a critical need is to develop an improved system combining advanced machine learning techniques, feature engineering, and behavioural analysis to detect phishing sites accurately and efficiently. By addressing these challenges, the proposed methodology aims to improve the security of online users, protect their sensitive information, and foster a safer digital environment.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-install all the required libraries
       1) OpenCV
       2) Keras
       3) Numpy
       4) Pandas
       5) OS
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the dataset
Datasets containing phishing and legitimate websites is collected from open-source platform PhishTank.
[click here!](https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/driver-drowsiness-detection-70c5e4)

This service provide a set of phishing URLs in multiple formats like csv, json etc. that gets updated hourly.
From this dataset, 5000 random phishing URLs are collected to train the machine learning models.

The legitimate URLs are obatined from the open datasets of the University of New Brunswick, [click here!](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html). 
This dataset has a collection of benign, spam, phishing, malware & defacement URLs. Out of all these types, the benign url dataset is considered for this project.
From this dataset, 5000 random legitimate URLs are collected to train the ML models.
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction
**The below-mentioned category of features are extracted from the URL data: ‚Äã**

1. Addressed Bar-based features‚Äã

    ‚Ä¢ In this category, 9 features are extracted.‚Äã

2. Domain-based Features‚Äã

    ‚Ä¢ In this category, 4 features are extracted.‚Äã

3. HTML & Javascript-based Features‚Äã

    ‚Ä¢ In this category, 4 features are extracted. ‚Äã

So, all together 17 features are extracted from the 10,000 URL dataset and are stored in '5.urldata.csv' file in the Data Files folder‚Äã
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and train the model

Before starting the ML model training, the data is split into 80-20, i.e., 8000 training samples & 2000 testing samples. From the dataset, it is clear that this is a supervised machine-learning task.

This data set comes under a classification problem, as the input URL is classified as phishing (1) or legitimate (0). ‚Äã

The supervised machine learning models (classification) considered to train the dataset in this project are:

‚Ä¢ Decision Tree

‚Ä¢ Random Forest

‚Ä¢ Multilayer Perceptrons

‚Ä¢ XGBoost

‚Ä¢ Autoencoder Neural Network

‚Ä¢ Support Vector Machines

# Project Deployment <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/130077430/230725195-2f024fca-9cae-4e91-85dc-4c12e0e1fcb0.png" width="90" height="80">

We have built an app using Flutter. Flutter helps Build, test, and deploy beautiful mobile, web, desktop, and embedded apps from a single codebase. It is a cross-platform app development framework by Google which goes hand in hand with the model to help ensure the safety of the user and other commuters. 

As soon as the model detects drowsiness, the model will send an API request call to the client app, which notifies the user to take some rest and shows the navigation option to the nearest resting places. If the user isn't drowsy, the app will give 10 seconds buffer time within which the user can confirm that he isn't sleepy by pressing the prompt on the screen. If the user is drowsy he will get a option for getting driving assistance from the nearby driving service providers. If the user has been detected drowsy more than three times within 10 minutes, a notification is sent to the highway patrol and the nearby drivers as a concern for the safety of other drivers and the drowsy driver.

    This project can be taken further by creating a browser extensions by developing a GUI. 

2) **Alcohol gas detection :**
    The MQ3 alcohol gas sensor is a module used for detecting alcohol, CH4, benzene, gasoline, hexane, CO, and LPG. It has a sensitive material namedSnO2 for     alcohol¬†gas¬†detection, This code can be easily pared with MQ3 sensor to extend its detection in¬†drunken¬†driving.

3) The machine learning models shown here can be easily served as REST API endpoints which can further be used with add-ons to detect phishing websites in real-time.
